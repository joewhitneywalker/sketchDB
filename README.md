THE PROBLEM:
THIS APPLICATION WAS CREATED TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. CURRENTLY MY TEAM HAS NO STANDARD FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS OR DATA ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE. THIS MAKES IT INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING TO SEARCH FOR TECHNICAL SKETCH FILES THAT YOU MAY NEED. THERE IS ALSO A LACK OF CENTRALIZATION, SO TO FIND EACH SKETCH YOU MUST DIG THROUGH WORKSPACES CREATED BY INDIVIDUALS. ADDITIONALLY, CROSS FUNCTIONAL TEAMS WHO NEED ACCESS TO THESE FILES NEED THEM IN DIFFERENT FORMATS. HOWEVER, UPLOADING THE DOCUMENT AS A PDF ALLOWS EACH TEAM TO OPEN THE FILE WITH THE SOFTWARE OF THEIR CHOOSING (ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR, ADOBE ACROBAT, READER, ETC). 

THE SOLVE:
I AM PROPOSING TO CREATE A WEB-BASED DATABASE THAT CAN HOLD ALL SKETCHES IN A .PDF FORMAT. EACH SKETCH MUST BE NAMED BY IT'S FIVE DIGIT STYLE NUMBER (ALSO KNOWN AS A PC5), TAGGED WITH THE CORRECT CATEGORY AND SEASON, AND HAVE CREATOR COMMENTS INSERTED FOR VERSION HISTORY. 


---------------------------------

USER STORIES:
THE USER WILL BE ABLE TO UPLOAD AND MANAGE PDF FILES BY SORTING THROUGH SEASON OR CATEGORY. ADDITIONALLY, THE USER CAN CREATE A LIBRARY TO HOUSE SKETCHES THAT ARE USED OFTEN. THE USER WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE VERSION HISTORY ON THE SKETCH DETAIL PAGE AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO DELETE & EDIT THEIR FILE NAMES AND COMMENTS, DELETE OTHER'S FILES, AND VIEW-ONLY OTHER'S COMMENTS. THE USER WILL ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO CANCEL THEIR DELETE REQUEST VIA A POP UP WINDOW THAT ASKS THEM IF THEY REALLY WANT TO DELETE. 

THE USER WILL BE ABLE TO UPDATE THEIR PASSWORD IN THEIR ACCOUNT, BUT THEIR NAME AND LOG INS WOULD BE STATIC, SET BY THE COMPANY. THE USER WILL BE ABLE TO SIGN OUT FROM THE DROP DOWN ARROW BY THEIR NAME, AND NAVGIATE TO HOME BY CLICKING ON THE "HOME" MENU NAV OR THE "LEVIS" ICON. ADDITIONALLY THE USER WILL BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH SELECTING A MENU ITEM ON THE NAV BAR. 

------------------------------------

DATA MODELS:
DATA MODEL 1:
1:M: THERE WILL BE ONCE STYLE NUMBER (PC5) THAT WILL RENDER MANY VERSIONS OF IT (FROM PREVIOUS SEASON)

DATA MODEL 2: 
M:M: AS THE SKETCHES ARE ALSO SEARCHABLE BY SEASON, CATEGORY OR BOTH, THERE ARE MANY SKETCHES TO MANY SEASONS. 

USER MODEL:
1:M: AS THE USER (1) CAN CREATE SEVERAL SKETCHES (MANY) AND SEVERAL COMMENTS (MANY)
